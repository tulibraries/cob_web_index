Paskow, a Temple alumnus. A subsequent donation in 1986 by Roger Knuth served to expand the collection not only in size but also in focus to include the fantasy genre. This extensive science fiction volume collection documents the evolution of science fiction and fantasy writing from the late 19<sup style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">th</sup>through the 20<sup style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">th</sup>&nbsp;century.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 12px; color: #494949; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; background-color: #fefefe;\">The collection also includes pulp and slick magazines, posters, paintings, drawing, and related ephemera. Science fiction and fantasy fan culture and criticism often referred to as science fiction fandom are documented in serials known as fanzines. &nbsp;Notable fanzine collections include the Women Writers Fan Fiction Collection, circa 1979-1996, which includes fanzines, underground, and circuit literature written, designed, produced and distributed by female fans of science fiction media teleplays, actors, and characters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 12px; color: #494949; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; background-color: #fefefe;\">The collection also includes the personal papers of science fiction and fantasy authors Ben Bova, Gardner Dozois, Lloyd Eshbach, Tom Purdom, John Varley, Stanley G.
