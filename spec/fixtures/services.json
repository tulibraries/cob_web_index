We publish works of scholarship, both new and reissued, from the Temple University community. We primarily publish textbooks with limited additional capacity to publish scholarly monographs, edited volumes, and digital scholarly projects. We consider other types of publications on a case-by-case basis. Everything North Broad Press publishes is open access and peer reviewed.</p>\r\n<p>Any individual faculty, student, staff member, department, center, or college associated with Temple University is eligible to submit their own scholarly content to North Broad Press for possible publication. In addition, we accept proposals for publications from nonprofit external organizations and societies located in Philadelphia, as long as they are sponsored by a Temple faculty member. </p>\r\n<p>Our basic services are offered to our affiliates without charge. In addition, we offer stipends to some Temple faculty who author an open textbook with us. Look for our next <a href=\"http://tupress.temple.edu/open-access/north-broad-press/call-for-proposals\">call for proposals</a> for faculty-authored open textbooks in spring 2020.</p>\r\n<p>The core principles of North Broad Press are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>We believe that the Libraries and the Press are critical resources for publishing expertise on campus.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>We believe that the unfettered flow of ideas, scholarship and knowledge is necessary to support learning, clinical practice, and research, and to stimulate creativity and the intellectual enterprise. </p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>We support Temple faculty, students, and staff by making their work available to audiences around the world via open access publishing.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>We believe that the scholarly ecosystem works best when creators retain their copyrights. </p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>We believe in experimentation and innovation in academic publishing.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>We work to decrease the cost of higher education and improve learning outcomes for students by publishing high quality open textbooks and other open educational resources.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>We believe in the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and promote these values through our publications.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>We commit to making our publications accessible to all who need to use them.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>We believe place matters.

        "description": "<h3>Q. What is an ETD?</h3>\r\n<p>A. ETD stands for “Electronic Thesis or Dissertation.” ETDs are often gathered by the degree-granting institution and deposited into digital repositories for public access.</p>\r\n<h3>Q. Where can I find ETDs from Temple University?</h3>\r\n<p>A. You can view Temple University ETDs in our <a href=\"http://digital.library.temple.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/p245801coll10\">digital collections repository</a>. You can search the ETD collection using your name as keyword.</p>\r\n<p>If you are unable to find your ETD and it has been more than six (6) months since your PhD or Master's degree was awarded, please email diglib@temple.edu with your full name, dissertation title, department, and date submitted so we can look into any issues. It is our understanding that ProQuest uploads your dissertation into their <a href=\"http://libproxy.temple.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/pqdt/index?accountid=14270\">database</a> within 6-8 weeks from the end of the semester.</p>\r\n<h3>Q. Is my dissertation listed in your online library catalog?</h3>\r\n<p>A. Yes. We copy the record describing your dissertation from the repository into the <a href=\"https://librarysearch.temple.edu/\">Library Search</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Q: I am a PhD student at Temple—must I submit my dissertation electronically?</h3>\r\n<p>A: Yes. As of September 2008, all PhD candidates must submit their dissertations electronically, and grant a limited non-exclusive license to Temple to include the dissertation in the University Libraries’ ETD repository.  </p>\r\n<h3>Q: I am a Master’s degree student at Temple—do I need to submit my masters paper or thesis electronically?</h3>\r\n<p>A: Yes. As of August 2010, Master's degree candidates presenting a thesis (as opposed to a master's paper) are required to submit the thesis in electronic format and grant a limited non-exclusive license to Temple to include the thesis in the University Libraries’ ETD repository. Master's papers do not have to be submitted electronically.  </p>\r\n<h3>Q. How do I submit my Temple dissertation or master’s thesis?</h3>\r\n<p>A. You will submit your dissertation or thesis through ProQuest. You can follow the instructions at the <a href=\"http://www.etdadmin.com/cgi-bin/school?siteId=171\">ProQuest ETD submittal site</a> for Temple University. If the instructions are unclear or you have questions on how to prepare your thesis or dissertation, check the Temple dissertation instructions in the <a href=\"http://www.temple.edu/grad/documents/dissertation-and-thesis-handbook.pdf\">Dissertation and Thesis Handbook</a>. Contact the <a href=\"http://www.temple.edu/grad/\">Temple Graduate School</a> if further help is needed either in formatting your paper, or to understand either your rights and the University’s graduation requirements—they are the experts in how to properly format and submit your thesis or dissertation.</p>\r\n<p>Be sure that what you submit to the Graduate School and ProQuest is the final, fully proofread version. We cannot accept changes to the final submitted document.</p>\r\n<h3>Q: I do not want to give up my copyright!</h3>\r\n<p>A: Good news! You retain copyright of your work. The submittal mechanism only grants ProQuest and Temple limited non-exclusive licenses to reproduce the dissertation or master’s thesis. Please read the publishing agreement from ProQuest for full details.</p>\r\n<h3>Q: I want to publish my dissertation (or master’s thesis) as a book.</h3>\r\n<p>A: Granting Temple University a limited non-exclusive license to preserve and present your work in our institutional ETD repository does not prevent you from revising and publishing your research in whole or in part. Publishers generally regard the unrevised dissertation or master’s thesis as substantially different from a monograph.</p>\r\n<h3>Q: Will I receive royalties?</h3>\r\n<p>A: ProQuest will if you select the “traditional publishing” option during submittal. ProQuest will pay royalties of 10% of its net revenue from sales of the work, conditioned on the author maintaining a current address on record with ProQuest. Royalties will be paid when accrued earned royalties reach $25.00 USD. If, after 25 years, earned royalties do not accrue to at least $25.00 USD, ProQuest's royalty payment obligation will cease.</p>\r\n<p>Be aware, however, that an open access copy of your work will be freely available online via the Libraries’ ETD repository. Temple University does not pay royalties. For more information on open access scholarship, view Temple’s <a href=\"https://guides.temple.edu/openaccess\">Open Access Research Guide</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Q: I do not want my dissertation (or master’s thesis) publicly accessible via the web. What do I do?</h3>\r\n<p>A: For both dissertations and master's theses, making your contribution to scholarship publicly accessible is a requirement in order to receive the degree from Temple University. You may, however, request that an embargo be placed on your dissertation or thesis for up to two years, during which time the ETD would not be publicly accessible. At the end of the embargo period, your work will be available through<a href=\"http://www.proquest.com/go/pqdtglobal\"> ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses</a>,<a href=\"http://www.proquest.com/go/iparadigms\"> iParadigms</a> and<a href=\"http://dissexpress.umi.com/dxweb/\"> Dissertation Express</a>, and a citation/abstract may appear in some<a href=\"http://www.proquest.com/go/third-party-pqdt\"> indexes</a> (e.g. SciFinder, MathSciNet, PsycINFO, etc.). In addition, the Libraries’ will automatically expose the scholarship in the ETD repository. If you need an extension, please contact the Graduate School.</p>\r\n<h3>Q: There are some images and diagrams from another author that I would like to include in my dissertation. Can I just include them?</h3>\r\n<p>A: Images, diagrams, or other materials from third-party sources may be under copyright. If you include copyrighted material of any sort in your dissertation/thesis, you MUST obtain the copyright holder's written permission for its inclusion and subsequent distribution. For instructions, and an example copyright permission letter, please see the <a href=\"http://www.temple.edu/grad/documents/dissertation-and-thesis-handbook.pdf\">Dissertation and Thesis Handbook</a>. If you need help or have additional questions about copyright, contact your subject librarian.</p>\r\n<h3>Q. There is an error in my dissertation. What do I do?</h3>\r\n<p>A. Contact the Graduate School to discuss your options.</p>\r\n<h3>Q. I made a mistake in the submittal process. What do I do?</h3>\r\n<p>A. Contact the Graduate School and explain the nature of the mistake. In the case of an omitted file, such as an appendix or musical score, this can be resolved through them. For other errors, such as requesting that ProQuest not release or sell on your behalf print copies of your dissertation, you should ask that the Graduate School assist you in contacting ProQuest.</p>\r\n<h3>Q. Why is my name (or dissertation title) in all capital letters in the description?</h3>\r\n<p>A. We copy the submitted description without any editing. Formatting, such as capitalization, is carried over from the submission to ProQuest.</p>\r\n<h3>Q: What does the library do to promote wider visibility and reading of my dissertation or master’s thesis?</h3>\r\n<p>A.  We upload the metadata describing your paper to three international databases:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/\">Temple University Library Search</a>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ndltd.org/\">The Networked Library of Digital Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD)</a>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/\">WorldCat</a>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>By listing the descriptive citation and abstract of your work in these international databases, anyone doing research in your specific area of study should turn up your work and find the embedded link back to to Temple’s ETD repository. Studies at other ETD repositories show that such exposure increases how often dissertations will be cited well beyond a simple listing in the fee-based ProQuest Dissertations database. Posting in a free open repository increases your impact on the scholarly world.</p>\r\n<h3>Q: Is a print copy of my dissertation (or master’s thesis) on the shelf somewhere in Paley Library?</h3>\r\n<p>A: If you submitted an ETD, we do not keep a paper or microfilm copy of the dissertation. For dissertations submitted prior to September 2008, we do have paper and microfilm copies at locations listed in the <a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/\">Temple University Library Search</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Q: Who keeps a backup copy of my dissertation then?</h3>\r\n<p>A: For dissertations or theses submitted electronically, the Libraries maintain, in a secure electronic storage system, an online disk backup of the PDF as submitted to us. That file is automatically backed up on additional disk arrays. The metadata and PDF included in the publicly searchable ETD repository is also backed up at two data centers in Ohio. We do not make or accept paper printouts of dissertations or theses submitted electronically. ProQuest also <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/products-services/dissertations/publishing-preservation.html\">preserves microform copies</a> of all electronically submitted dissertations.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

        "description": "<p>The Open Access Publishing Fund supports faculty who would like to publish in an open access journal but do not have the funds to cover the article processing charge. </p>\r\n<p>The Libraries’ goal in starting the Open Access Publishing Fund is to promote new forms of scholarly communication. There are a number of high-quality open access publishers whose business model depends on the fees they collect from authors. Authors are increasingly interested in making their work available open access, as it helps them reach new and wider audiences. However, the costs involved can be a deterrent. We hope this Fund will help remove this financial barrier, encouraging authors to experiment with new and innovative publishing models. </p>\r\n<p>The Open Access Publishing Fund is open to all current Temple faculty members. Current postdoctoral fellows, residents, and graduate students may also apply, as long as there is at least one faculty member listed as a co-author on the article.</p>\r\n<h2>How to Apply</h2>\r\n<p>Authors with a journal article that has been accepted or is under consideration by an open access publisher are encouraged to apply. Authors simply fill out a <a href=\"https://sites.temple.edu/scholarlycommunication/files/2018/08/OAPublishingFundApplication2019-2020.docx\">brief application form</a> with their information, a copy of the article, and a copy of the journal acceptance letter (if available). Funds are available on a first come, first served basis. The Libraries will aim to make a final decision regarding the application within two weeks’ time. If the request is approved, Libraries will transfer funds to authors’ research fund or departmental account. The Libraries cannot reimburse authors or pay publishers directly.</p>\r\n<h2>Applicant Eligibility</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Applicants must be a current Temple University faculty member OR a current postdoctoral fellow/resident/graduate student with a faculty member listed as a co-author.</li>\r\n<li>Applicants with external grant funding that could cover, either in whole or in part, the cost of any publication and processing fees are ineligible.</li>\r\n<li>Applicants must agree to deposit a copy of their publication in our <a href=\"https://digital.library.temple.edu/digital/\">Digital Library</a>, or any future library repository.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Publication Eligibility</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The publication must take the form of a peer-reviewed journal article.</li>\r\n<li>Many subscription journals now offer an open access option in which authors can choose to pay a fee to make their article open access. These publications are sometimes called “hybrid” open access journals. Articles in “hybrid” journals are not supported.</li>\r\n<li>The journal must be listed in the <a href=\"https://doaj.org/\">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> (DOAJ). The DOAJ is a community-curated online directory that indexes high quality, open access, peer-reviewed journals.</li>\r\n<li>The publisher must be a member of the <a href=\"https://oaspa.org/\">Open Access Scholarly Publishing Association</a> (OASPA), or clearly follow the membership criteria of the organization.</li>\r\n<li>Because the Libraries already cover 50% of the APC for <a href=\"https://www.biomedcentral.com/about/institutional-support/membership/1600019565\">BioMed Central journals</a>, these journals are not eligible.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Additional Stipulations</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Each applicant may request up to $1,500 total per fiscal year. This amount may be split across multiple applications so long as funds are available.</li>\r\n<li>For articles with multiple Temple authors, the per article payment is capped at $3,000.</li>\r\n<li>Funding will cover publication and processing fees only. Funds may not be used for reprints, color illustration fees, non-open access page charges, permissions fees, web hosting for self-archiving, or other expenses not directly related to open access fees.</li>\r\n<li>For applicants who have not yet submitted for publication, requests will be conditionally approved awaiting official acceptance by the publisher. All conditional approvals will expire six months after notification. Applicants must provide a copy of the acceptance letter before the invoice is processed.</li>\r\n<li>Fees are prorated for multi-authored articles. Co-authors from outside of Temple are not supported. If an article includes non-Temple authors, the APC will be divided equally among all authors and then the Temple authors’ portion will be funded. For example, if the APC is $2000, and there are four authors, two of whom are from Temple, the authors can apply for $1000 from the fund ($500 each).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Attribution Requirement</h2>\r\n<p>Authors who receive support must include the following statement in their acknowledgements: Publication of this article was funded in part by the Temple University Libraries Open Access Publishing Fund.</p>",

Many federal grants require a short DMP addressing particular data management needs, like privacy and data sharing. A DMP can be longer, though, and include details of every aspect of data management planned for the research project. This can help prevent mistakes and extra work later down the line, like renaming all of your files at the end of the project so they are not confusing to future researchers.</p>\r\n<p>These are some of the areas that a DMP covers:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Roles and responsibilities</li>\r\n<li>Data types and formats</li>\r\n<li>Data collection methods</li>\r\n<li>File naming, folder organization and other data management</li>\r\n<li>Ethics and intellectual property</li>\r\n<li>Data sharing, and reuse</li>\r\n<li>Short-Term Storage and Security</li>\r\n<li>Long-Term Preservation and Repositories</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can find more about DMPs here (link to libguide)</p>\r\n<p>For NSF DMPs the DART DMP Rubric can help grade a DMP: <a href=\"https://osf.io/mgjpp/\"><span class=\"s2\">https://osf.io/mgjpp/</span></a></p>\r\n<p>Guide on writing a DMP: <a href=\"http://www.asu.edu/lib/tutorials/storyline/writing-rdmp/story_html5.html\">http://www.asu.edu/lib/tutorials/storyline/writing-rdmp/story_html5.html</a></p>\r\n<p>[Placeholder text below-- from Princeton U]</p>\r\n<p>It provides a guiding document to refer to as you perform your research and can serve as standard operating procedure for a research group. This is especially helpful for collaborative projects or long lived projects with short-term or often changing research assistants. These data management plans are longer and more detailed than the plans created for grant applications. Although there may be some differences depending on research domain, in general a good data management plan will address the following aspects:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Define roles and responsibilities of research team members</li>\r\n<li>Data types and formats</li>\r\n<li>Capture methods and file naming</li>\r\n<li>Ethics and Intellectual Property</li>\r\n<li>Access, Data Sharing, and Reuse</li>\r\n<li>Short-Term Storage and Data Management</li>\r\n<li>Deposit and Long-Term Preservation</li>\r\n<li>Resourcing (<a href=\"http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/develop-data-plan\">Jones, 2011</a>)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The Digital Curation Centre in the U.K. has an excellent data management plan checklist<a href=\"http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP_Checklist_2013.pdf\"> <span class=\"s2\"><em>Checklist for a Data Management Plan.</em></span></a></p>",

        "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>\r\n<p>Temple University Libraries is committed to barrier-free access to a rich array of resources for our communities. One way we work to achieve this is by supporting textbook affordability. A survey found that as many as 64% of students do not buy course textbooks due to their prohibitive and burdensome cost. Another 42% of students said the cost of textbooks affected their decisions about course selection. Additional studies have found that the high cost of textbooks are not only prohibiting students from purchasing course materials, but also having a negative impact on student success and outcomes.</p>\r\n<h2>Objective</h2>\r\n<p>Join over 75 of your teaching colleagues who have helped save students money and advance open education by applying to the Textbook Affordability Project for an award ranging from $500 to $1,500. Replace costly educational resources with materials available through Temple Libraries or open educational resources (OER)* that are freely available to students, including open textbooks!<strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p>* Open educational resources are educational materials and resources that are publicly accessible, meaning that they are freely available for anyone to use, and under some licenses to re-mix, improve and redistribute.</p>\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>One of the longest running textbook affordability projects at an academic institution, the Textbook Affordability Project, originally the Alternate Textbook Project, was launched by the Temple University Teaching, Learning &amp; Technology Roundtable and Associate University Librarian, Steven Bell, in 2011. Since then, the project has granted awards to over 76 faculty across nearly every discipline at Temple University and saved students over one million dollars!<strong> </strong></p>\r\n<h2>Award Opportunities &amp; Selection Criteria</h2>\r\n<p>Any of the following, or a combination, are eligible for an award*:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Adopt an open textbook</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Adapt content available through the library to create your own version of a textbook at no cost to students</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Create an open educational resource or open assignment</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>*The Textbook Affordability Project does not require you to author an open textbook. If you are interested in authoring or editing an open textbook, please refer to <a href=\"http://tupress.temple.edu/open-access/north-broad-press/call-for-proposals\">North Broad Press</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Awards range from $500 to $1,500 depending on a variety of criteria that will be evaluated by a panel consisting of Associate University Librarian: Steven Bell; Library Publishing and Scholarly Communications Specialist: Annie Johnson; former award recipient: Associate Professor Natalie Flynn; subject specialist librarian: Kristina De Voe; SCRC representative: Josue Hurtado, and member at large: Urooj Nizami.</p>\r\n<p>Applications will be assessed on the following criteria to determine award amount:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>What are the potential savings to Temple students?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Is the project transferable to other courses?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Does this project propose creative use of Temple Libraries’ Special Collections Research Center resources?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>What is the scope, complexity and scale of proposed project?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Does this project represent an underrepresented subject area/ department within previous TAP cohorts?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Does the proposed project adhere to <a href=\"https://www.temple.edu/about/temple-university-accessibility-statement\">Temple University accessibility standards</a>?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Does the proposed project comply with copyright regulations?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Eligibility</h2>\r\n<p>Any tenured, tenure track, non tenure track, or adjunct faculty member is eligible for this award. Instructors can apply and be awarded up to two awards in different academic years, as long as the course for which they are applying is distinct from previous applications, or if their project proposal significantly builds upon a previous award. The adoption of a lower priced digital version of a textbook or an inclusive textbook deal are ineligible proposals for the Textbook Affordability Project. We cannot accept award applications retroactively in cases where low to no-cost course materials have already been implemented. In cases where more than one faculty member chooses to partner on a project, their must be a primary awardee to whom award funds can be disbursed. Projects must propose lowering costs for students and/or opening up their course by using open content or materials available through Temple Libraries.</p>\r\n<p>Applications open on April 15, 2019 and will be accepted for all semesters in the 2019-2020 academic year. Applications will be accepted until May 3, 2019. Applicants will be notified of results by May 31, 2019. If funds permit, we will continue to accept applications beyond the deadline.</p>\r\n<h2>Special Recognition Opportunity</h2>\r\n<p>Each year, an awardee that demonstrates exceptional creativity and innovation in reducing course material costs to students will receive special recognition and, contingent on the availability of funding from the Library and University Administration, the chance to attend a conference on open education paid for by the libraries.</p>\r\n<h2>Application Requirements</h2>\r\n<p>Submit an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSctlh2t9WY1BGNacxJKvUToFeQ0t34KqHXXMhzS79_QUxa6jQ/viewform?usp=sf_link\">online application</a>* including a narrative that describes your plan for moving toward a more affordable course material model by replacing commercial textbooks and other fee-based learning materials. Details can be found within the application. Refer to sample project proposal narrative for an example proposal.</p>\r\n<p>*Be sure to be logged in with your Temple University credentials in order to access the application.</p>\r\n<h2>Award Requirements</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Attend an orientation workshop for awardees where you will learn more about textbook affordability and library resources</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Attend a consultation with subject librarian and/or archivist to get better acquainted with subject specific resources you can integrate into your course</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Deposit reworked syllabi into Temple University Libraries’ Institutional Repository to promote the ethic of accessibility and openness</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Attend a farewell lunch where you will have a chance to meet and discuss your experiences with fellow awardees within your cohort</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Submit an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWclURr_1h-1uefAfy1NrwYA8zo29YxlLmGzwTUHookZ4KXg/viewform?usp=sf_link\">evaluation form</a> that will help us assess your experience, your students’ experience, and the program as a whole. Refer to sample project evaluation for a example narrative.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Be available to participate in future assessment of the program and other library initiatives</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Awards are disbursed at the conclusion of a project, once the final evaluation has been submitted.</p>",

Professor Ramella observed that student participation increased as a result of better preparedness for class.</p>\r\n<h3>Adapt</h3>\r\n<p>Jodi Levine-Laufgraben, from the Department of Higher Education saved students $30, for a total of $900 in her 30 person course in Fall 2016 by opting not to use a traditional textbook. Vice Provost Levine-Laufgraben carefully curated readings from multiple library resources and identified public domain, primary source documents such as Brown v. Board of Education and US congressional charters.</p>\r\n<h3>Create</h3>\r\n<p>Seth Bruggeman, from the Department of American History, assigned students a semester-long project researching the history of the Alfred E. Burk Mansion in North Philadelphia. This project was initiated with materials found in Temple University’s Special Collections Research Center. Students were tasked with drafting an updated statement of historical significance and imaging a new use for the vacant space. The class presented their findings to representatives from the administration. Students published blog posts throughout the semester that were made available on a course webpage that was publicly accessible.*</p>\r\n<p>The idea behind open assignments is to challenge the lifespan of traditional assignments that oftentimes end when the instructor assigns a grade. Instead, open assignments shift the utility of students’ effort and work away from a grade toward a public good. An open assignment focuses on reusing, remixing, and revising information by redistributing that information for further reach.</p>\r\n<p>*Professor Bruggeman’s course was not part of the Textbook Affordability Project.</p>\r\n<h3>Support</h3>\r\n<p>If you are seeking additional examples and support, please reach out to the subject specialist librarian serving your discipline.

Instructors can also provide their own items to be placed on reserve.</p>\r\n<p>By placing material on reserve, the instructor ensures that these items are readily available for use by multiple students for the entire semester.</p>\r\n<h2>How to submit course reserve requests</h2>\r\n<p>You can submit course reserve requests by enabling the Course Reserve tool in Canvas.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Log into <a href=\"http://canvas.temple.edu/\">Canvas</a> and select your course.</li>\r\n<li>Add the Course Reserve tool to the Course Navigation Menu by selecting settings and opening the Navigation tab.</li>\r\n<li>Drag and drop the Course reserves tool into Course Navigation or select the menu︙to the right of Course Reserves and Enable it.</li>\r\n<li>Scroll to the bottom of the page and save your changes.</li>\r\n<li>Select the “Course Reserves” link you created and choose a semester to be directed to your Course Reserves homepage.</li>\r\n<li>Make new requests or import items you had on reserve previously by choosing Add New or Import Previous items under the Instructor Course Tools Menu.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Guidelines and policies</h2>\r\n<h3>Charles Library </h3>\r\n<p>Students can check out a book on reserve for a 3 hour, Library Use Only, loan period at the One Stop Assistance desk. They can scan or photocopy the pages they need. Reserve books cannot be renewed. </p>\r\n<p>Students can check out media reserves for a 4 hour, Library Use Only, loan period at the One Stop Assistance desk. Portable DVD players and headphone splitters are available to borrow.  </p>\r\n<h3>Ambler Library</h3>\r\n<p>Books and DVDs placed on reserve at the Ambler Campus Library can be picked up at the library’s combined service desk and are subject to similar loan periods.</p>\r\n<h3>Health Sciences Libraries</h3>\r\n<p>Books and DVDs placed on reserve at the Ginsburg Health Science Library can be picked up at the library’s circulation desk.</p>\r\n<p>Books and DVDs placed on reserve at the Podiatry Library can be picked up at the library’s circulation desk.</p>\r\n<h3>Placing materials on reserve</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Requests are processed on a first come, first served basis. Instructors need to place their requests as soon as possible before the beginning of the semester to ensure timely processing. </li>\r\n<li>Reserves staff will process reserve requests for the current semester. Due to the volume of requests we receive, we are unable to fulfill requests that are not for a course you are currently teaching.</li>\r\n<li>Requests for scans of up to 20% of a book will be eligible for fulfillment through Course Reserves. Eligible patrons must make one unique request for each individual chapter or serial article they wish to have scanned.</li>\r\n<li>Hardcopy materials not owned by Temple Libraries will be purchased. For scanning, materials will be acquired through E-ZBorrow or ILLiad. Please plan accordingly, as it can take time to order and process new items. Also, please be aware that films go out-of-print and rights issues may prevent films from being available.</li>\r\n<li>The library will not purchase e-books for course reserves, but will link to e-books we already own. Usage restrictions may apply.</li>\r\n<li>Journal articles and book chapters are placed on electronic reserve, via a weblink or pdf. Text recognition is run on PDFs via Adobe, however, to ensure full ADA compliance you must contact the<a href=\"http://teaching.temple.edu/\"> Center for the Advancement of Teaching</a> and/or<a href=\"http://disabilityresources.temple.edu/\"> Disability Resources and Services</a>.</li>\r\n<li>Instructors' personal materials may be placed on reserve, provided they comply with copyright law. These items will be marked with labels and barcodes and will sustain more than your average wear and tear. While the library makes every effort to ensure that instructors' personal materials are not stolen or damaged, this does sometimes happen. Temple University Libraries cannot be responsible for the replacement or compensation of lost or damaged material.</li>\r\n<li>Items are automatically removed from reserve at the end of each semester.</li>\r\n</ul>",

        "title": "Cultural Analytics Certificate Program",
        "description": "<h2>What is Cultural Analytics?</h2>\r\n<p>“Cultural Analytics” refers to the analysis of cultural objects assisted by computers.</p>\r\n<p>Much of modern culture exists in digital form. Digital versions of traditional humanistic materials—books, films, paintings, sculptures, and artifacts―are readily available for study. Graduate students who work with digital materials benefit from specialized training in managing and manipulating their materials, so that they can take full advantage of its digital form.</p>\r\n<h2>What is the Cultural Analytics program?</h2>\r\n<p>Open to all students, the program is an interdisciplinary effort by the College of Liberal Arts, Klein College of Media and Communication, Tyler School of Art, the School of Education, the Center for the Performing and Cinematic Arts, the College of Science and Technology, and Temple University Libraries. We work together to train graduate students how to use computational methods to study images, books, objects, and other cultural products.</p>\r\n<p>The certificate program prepares students for advanced research in their discipline by allowing them to specialize in the specific skills that are most relevant to their research. It encourages participants to work within one of the following focal areas:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>data visualization</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>mapping and geographic information systems</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>basic programming</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>research design and analysis</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>statistics</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>social media research</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>text encoding and analysis</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>virtual environments</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Because of the intersecting needs for training in these methods, we recognize that we can offer a stronger certificate program by joining forces than by creating overlapping programs on our own. The course of study supplements instruction offered by each student's degree program by enabling students to learn the techniques they need to use cultural analytics professionally in the dissertation, thesis, or culminating event.</p>\r\n<p>As such, it strengthens their degree-related research and leads to more innovative projects and grant-funding possibilities than would otherwise be possible. Students are expected to work closely with their academic adviser throughout their certificate progress.</p>\r\n<h2>What are the program requirements?</h2>\r\n<p>Students must take 9 credits of coursework and a variable credit (0-1) practicum to complete the Certificate.</p>\r\n<p>The curriculum begins with an introductory course that surveys the full range of current research methods in the field, so that students are aware of the different techniques they can apply to their own research questions. This survey is followed by two electives selected from a list of courses that represent the distinct methodological emphases in the field, giving students a chance to gain a solid understanding of the conceptual and technical material they need to master.</p>\r\n<p>The concluding experience is a workshop in which students complete a research project for the dissertation, thesis, or culminating event. The workshop is overseen by staff from the Scholars Studio of Temple Libraries. This facility has both the equipment and the technical expertise to guide students in the process of completing their projects, and the workshop format gives all participating students a community to work with during the process.</p>\r\n<p>Because this final project is intended as part of their graduate program, students are required to work closely with their academic adviser. Both the workshop director and academic adviser must assign a passing grade to the final project for successful completion of the certificate program.</p>\r\n<h2>Why should I apply?</h2>\r\n<p>The certificate will be a valuable asset for students seeking academic careers. While the overall number of tenure track jobs has declined in recent years, the prevalence of listings requiring skills in digital research or analytics has increased.</p>\r\n<p>The certificate also opens up new career paths for students interested in using their M.A., M.S, M.F.A., or Ph.D. outside the academy. These skills enhance their chances for finding positions in a range of careers, from private businesses to museums and archives.</p>\r\n<h2>How do I apply?</h2>\r\n<p>Fall and Spring: Admission is on a rolling basis. Students currently enrolled in a graduate degree program at Temple University must submit a  personal statement of no more than 250 words and complete the <a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/cac/internal-application\">Internal Application Form</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Applicants not currently enrolled at Temple are welcome. Please submit a  personal statement of no more than 250 words and complete the <a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/cac/external-application\">External Application Form</a>. External applicants must also submit official transcripts for all coursework taken since high school, whether or not a degree was earned from the institution(s). Evidence of the award of a baccalaureate degree from an accredited university must be shown.</p>\r\n<p>Bachelor's Degree in Discipline/Related Discipline: Applicants already admitted to a graduate degree program at Temple University have demonstrated that they possess the required bachelor's degree. Applicants not currently enrolled in a Temple University graduate degree program and applicants enrolled in a graduate degree program at another university must submit official transcripts for all coursework taken since high school, whether or not a degree was earned from the institution(s). Evidence of the award of a baccalaureate degree from an accredited university with an undergraduate GPA of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale must be shown.</p>\r\n<p>Additional Requirements for Students Not Currently Enrolled in a Graduate Degree Program at Temple University:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Two letters of recommendation from persons in a position to evaluate the applicant’s academic ability and accomplishments.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>A personal statement of no more than 250 words indicating interests, plans, and objectives within the field of Cultural Analytics.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>About the Certificate</h2>\r\n<p>This graduate certificate in Cultural Analytics trains students in humanistic and non-scientific fields how to use computational methods to analyze cultural objects. Much of modern culture originates in digital form. Digital versions of traditional humanistic materials -- books, films, paintings, sculptures, and artifacts -- are readily available for study. Graduate students who work with digital materials benefit from specialized training in managing and manipulating their materials, so that they can take full advantage of its digital form. The certificate program prepares students for advanced research in their discipline by allowing them to specialize in the specific skills that are most relevant to their research. It encourages participants to work within one of the following focal areas:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>data visualization</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>mapping and geographic information systems</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>basic programming</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>research design and analysis</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>statistics</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>social media research</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>text encoding and analysis</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>virtual environments</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This Certificate facilitates work on a dissertation, thesis, or culminating event by offering training in these technical skills along with the conceptual background needed to understand the opportunities and obstacles each method brings with it. Students must take 9 credits of course work and a variable credit (0-1) practicum to complete the Certificate. The introductory course surveys the range of methods. Students then select two electives in the focal area needed for their own research interests. Finally, students complete a project of their own design in the Practicum, a semester-long workshop offered by the Digital Scholarship Center/Scholars Studio of Temple University Libraries. For students currently enrolled in a graduate degree program, the final project will be part of the dissertation or thesis and will be overseen by their academic adviser. Non-matriculated students will sign up for a one-credit independent study with a faculty member who can serve as an academic adviser on their project.</p>\r\n<h3>Campus Location</h3>\r\n<p>Main</p>\r\n<h3>Time Limit for Certificate Completion</h3>\r\n<p>3 years</p>\r\n<h3>Full-Time/Part-Time Status</h3>\r\n<p>The graduate certificate can be completed on a part-time basis.</p>\r\n<h3>Non-Matriculated Student Policy</h3>\r\n<p>Non-matriculated students may take up to 9 credits of coursework before applying to the graduate certificate program.

        "description": "<p>The Community Computer Program was established in 2009 under former Dean of Temple Libraries Larry Alford. Participants in the program are non-Temple affiliates, majority of user population consists of Philadelphia residents and others living in the tri-state area. Members of the program include Temple alumni. There are twelve community computers with Microsoft Suite Software, a black and white change operated printer, two scanners, and a charging station for all cellular devices. Community members and alumni are permitted two hours a day on computers, additional time may be given as a courtesy at staff discretion. All on-site computers have access to university licensed academic databases.</p>\r\n<p>Two types of community members: Computer Users &amp; PA Borrowers. Both arrive at our main service point and apply. A current valid state issued ID is necessary and an active email to create their account in our ILS system. Computer Users may only use computers and have access to printers, scanners, and charging stations. PA Borrowers are subject to the same criteria to apply but must have a state issued ID with a current PA address and have the same access as Computer Users but may also check out up to ten library books. </p>\r\n<p>Community members are subject to Temple police approval of applicants and agree to abide by Library Code of Conduct when signing up. Submission and processing time of applicants can take up to two weeks Alumni using the Community Computers must attain an Alumni Card from the Alumni Office in Sullivan Hall. Once this ID is received, they can use all listed resources and check out up to ten books and/or movies. </p>\r\n<p>Student Tech Assistants employed by the library in the Community Computer Lab aid community members and alumni in navigating university resources and providing supplemental technological service. Workshops held in Job Readiness such as resume formatting, cover letter construction, and professional etiquette are open to community members that utilize these skills on the computers. Likewise GED completion programs conducted by PASCEP on campus can be applied to and navigated from the computers.</p>",
