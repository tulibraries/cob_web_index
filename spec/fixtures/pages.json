        "description": "<h3 class=\"p1\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">In 2017, the Temple University Libraries &amp; University Press (TULUP) Diversity &amp; Inclusion (D&amp;I) Committee was charged with mapping the trajectory of diversity and inclusion initiatives at TULUP. The TULUP D&amp;I Committee facilitated the creation of a Diversity Statement in order to guide TULUP&rsquo;s commitment to the range of human representations in all areas of our work. In an effort to exemplify a commitment to engaging diverse voices, all TULUP staff were invited to share their input on the statement. The TULUP D&amp;I Committee used these suggestions to shape the Diversity Statement you see below and continues to work diligently to facilitate TULUP&rsquo;s upholding of the principles within it.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Diversity Statement</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The staff of Temple University Libraries and Press strive to engage, include, and serve the full diversity of the Temple academic and local communities regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, religion, socioeconomic status, veteran status, culture, language, political views, citizenship status, or diverse abilities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We are dedicated to the principles and practices of social justice, diversity, and equity among our staff, collections, and services.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">While our staff is not as diverse as the communities we serve, we are working toward our commitment to the recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We hope to act as a catalyst to our users to challenge their own assumptions and viewpoints, while also intentionally building collections and services that let users see themselves reflected. We strive to create safe spaces in our buildings and on our websites, and do not tolerate harassment or hate speech in any form.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We're fully committed to eliminating barriers to learning and fostering access for our communities. The development of a diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment is a continuous process. We&rsquo;re taking small steps every day towards our goals, including regular attention to these issues and calls to action from our standing Diversity and Inclusion Committee.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">How could we be doing better? Let us know at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:asktulibrary@temple.edu\"><span class=\"s1\">asktulibrary@temple.edu</span></a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p class=\"p1\">(Revised &amp; Re-affirmed, September 2017)<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Temple University Libraries &amp; the University Press will foster learning, enhance intellectual life, amplify scholarly impact, and extend the reach of the imagination for their diverse local, national, and global communities through concerted action in these key areas:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">1. Designing and building a dramatically new library environment to serve as a catalyst for academic enterprise at Temple.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">At the heart of the Temple campus, this new central library will embody emerging modes of library mission while sustaining and transforming traditional library functions and commitments, with a quality and thoughtfulness of design that will be a model for other research universities nationally and internationally in the digital age.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">2. Enriching the environment for learning and student success.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The libraries will be a rich ecosystem for learning, providing services, instruction, tools and materials in light of diverse and evolving student needs, interests and predilections, in dialog with faculty and administrators, with an emphasis on curricular integration of information literacy, personalization and personal contact.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">3. Developing programs, services, and resources to enhance intellectual productivity, scholarly infrastructure, new modes of research, and clinical care services.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The libraries will support a diverse environment for the exploration of new modes of scholarship, engaging all fields of academic endeavor as a multi-disciplinary contact zone and intellectual workshop, connecting students, clinicians and scholars with collections, tools, librarians, and technical experts.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">4. Exploring new opportunities in publishing and scholarly communication.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The libraries will engage in deep collaboration with Temple University Press, with Temple faculty, and with other organizations and academic institutions to identify and adopt new approaches for sharing scholarly products, for exploring sustainable economic models for university publishing, and for connecting local publishing initiatives with Temple&rsquo;s faculty.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">5. Seeking partners in innovation and experimentation to add value to library programs and to identify new avenues for economic support.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The libraries will connect with a broad set of partners and collaborators at Temple and beyond to amplify their capacity for innovation, invention, and the exploration of emerging opportunities, both in technological domains (gaming, data visualization, data management, digital scholarship, health informatics etc.) and in areas where new revenue opportunities may be involved (publishing, foundation support, corporate partnerships, donor support, joint training and certification programs, etc.).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">6. Serving as a center of intellectual and cultural life.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The libraries will engage with schools and colleges, academic departments, interest groups, individuals, and community organizations to stimulate conversation, support the exchange of ideas, to provide a lively agenda of events, serving as a center of intellectual, cultural and civic life for Temple University and its neighboring urban community.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">7. Serving as a repository of record for archival, rare, and unique materials and providing broad access to those collections.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Building on deep archives and special collections that reflect not only Temple&rsquo;s institutional history, mission, and geographical centrality to the Philadelphia urban community, but also its commitment to intellectual engagement in the arts, book arts, and alternative movements, and recognizing the reputation of the Blockson Collection as an important resource for African American history and culture, the libraries will continue to expand their holdings, providing access to an ever growing set of their holdings in digital form.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">8. Building a world-class staff for leadership in the research library enterprise.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Recognizing that leadership, innovation, creativity, and dynamism in any enterprise are the product of personal commitment and staff empowerment, the libraries will create a flexible and forward-looking work environment that embraces transparent management practices, clear communication channels, individual accountability, fiscal responsibility, efficiency, a culture of experiment and continuous learning, opportunities for growth, and work-life balance, with the goal of becoming a model organization for contemporary research libraries.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">9. Sharing the vision, making connections, broadening support.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">As Temple University Libraries realize the ambition to be leaders in defining 21st century academic librarianship, they must share their story and build on successes and lessons learned, identifying further opportunities for growth and innovation, and opening up new avenues for support and partnership via private, corporate and foundation philanthropy and through cooperative enterprise with other organizations and institutions nationally and globally.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>",

The University Libraries&rsquo; Special Collections Research Center (SCRC) Research Center welcomes inquiries about potential donations of books, documents, organizational records, photographs, and other materials that complement our research collections.

Temple University cannot provide monetary appraisals of donated material or pay for such appraisals due to IRS regulations. If you wish to have a gift appraised, we can offer a list of reputable independent appraisers whom you may contact directly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Once accepted, your gift becomes the property of the Temple University Libraries. If any materials are ultimately not added to the collections, we reserve the right to dispose of the material as necessary through exchange, sale, or other means.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">Forms and helpful links</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8283.pdf\"><strong>IRS form 8283</strong></a></span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">Questions?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Contact Brian Schoolar at <a href=\"mailto:jbrian@temple.edu\"><span class=\"s3\">jbrian@temple.edu</span></a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p>August 2018</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">On behalf of Temple University Libraries, welcome to the 2018&ndash;2019 academic year. If you have visited us on main campus lately, I&rsquo;m sure you have noticed the progress on our new&nbsp;<a href=\"http://library.temple.edu/newlibrary\"><span class=\"s1\">Charles Library</span></a>&nbsp;(if you haven&rsquo;t, view our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://library.temple.edu/webcams\"><span class=\"s1\">livestream</span></a>). Even as we anticipate its grand opening next year, we are busy with myriad other activities, from developing new projects to growing our collections to providing valuable services.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">In August, we released an enhanced version of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/\"><span class=\"s1\">Library Search</span></a>, which allows you to more easily discover the resources you need, including books, e-books, journals, videos/DVDs, government documents, journal articles, and our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://digital.library.temple.edu/\"><span class=\"s1\">digital collections</span></a>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Library Search also allows you to browse materials in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/scrc\"><span class=\"s1\">Special Collections Research Center (SCRC)</span></a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/collections/blockson\"><span class=\"s1\">Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection</span></a>. I encourage you to visit these two very special collections in person too, in order to encounter their rare and unique materials first-hand.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">As always, our expert&nbsp;<a href=\"http://library.temple.edu/services/library-instruction/specialists\"><span class=\"s1\">subject librarians</span></a>&nbsp;are available for questions and consultations in a variety of ways&mdash;from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/\"><span class=\"s1\">Ask a Librarian</span></a>&nbsp;chat window on the library&rsquo;s homepage, to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/asktulibraries#tab5\"><span class=\"s1\">text messaging</span></a>, to in-person and online&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/asktulibraries#tab2\"><span class=\"s1\">appointments</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The Libraries continue to be your center for collaboration, innovation, and gathering. Receive expert guidance on using the latest technology in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sites.temple.edu/tudsc/\"><span class=\"s1\">Digital Scholarship Center</span></a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://guides.temple.edu/innovationspace\"><span class=\"s1\">Innovation Space</span></a>, sign up for free&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/beyondthepage?event-category%5B%5D=7\"><span class=\"s1\">library workshops</span></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paleystudy.temple.edu/\"><span class=\"s1\">book group study rooms</span></a>&nbsp;ahead of time.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">And don&rsquo;t forget to check out the free cultural and academic programs we offer during the academic year as part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://library.temple.edu/beyondthepage\"><span class=\"s1\">Beyond the Page</span></a>&nbsp;public programming series. The theme for this year is Access &amp; Opportunity, and we invite you to join us in conversations about what barriers&mdash;whether cultural, financial, physical, or otherwise&mdash;limit opportunities and how we can move toward a more accessible world.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">For current updates, programs, and resources, consider following the Libraries on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://instagram.com/tulibraries/\"><span class=\"s1\">Instagram</span></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://facebook.com/templelibraries/\"><span class=\"s1\">Facebook</span></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://twitter.com/TempleLibraries\"><span class=\"s1\">Twitter</span></a>. And visit us, either in person or online, for inspiration, for encouragement, and for connection. I wish you the best this academic year.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">With warm regards,</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Joe Lucia</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Dean of University Libraries</p>",

His work examines the impact of new technologies in the humanities and arts. His films and new-media works include Unknown Territories (2011), V&eacute;rit&eacute; to Virtual (DER, 2008), The Theory of Time Here (Video Data Bank, 2007), and Cultures in Webs (Eastgate, 2003), among others. As a DSC Faculty fellowship recipient in 2017-2018, Rod worked on the multimedia arts and sciences project Altering Shores. The project concerns land-use and climate change in the Delaware River estuary and its tributaries. During this research period, he produced three important new works that integrated historical and map-based studies with location-based field studies on land use and climate change. The year culminated in the premiere exhibition of two of the original works at the Schuylkill Center for Environmental Education and the presentation of original research at the University of Pennsylvania. These presentations also contributed to his receiving the award at the University of Pennsylvania to further the multi-stage project. Additional aspects of this research have led to papers and presentations in Asia, Europe and the USA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img title=\"Seher Erdogan Ford\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/paRxZVFwWXb7VxqNUPqDRstRrOjqEKeAafMW7Lxjeh4E-AmZ27KFEOLlEkguB7SUYAEsscaM4Oi93lHnPGhoeH04QccUdhs6Ok0Bonl4qej8uZMBIXKhdxt4CW1CPEosb7CCedGB\" alt=\"Seher Erdogan Ford\" width=\"200\" height=\"272\" /></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Seher Edrogan is an Assistant Professor in the Architecture department at Tyler School of Art. She is an architect and the co-founder of EFFO, a design and research practice based in Philadelphia. Her research deals with the visual and multimedia representation of architectural heritage sites through the lens of material culture. During her fellowship at the DSC in the 2017-18 academic year, she advanced her work on a virtual 3D reconstruction project of the 5th century Byzantine Church of Stoudius, later converted to the Mosque of Imrahor by the Ottomans, in present-day Istanbul, Turkey. In collaboration with a VR technologist and interactive designers, she developed a prototypical immersive environment, in which virtual visitors can navigate the building and discover the layers of transformation the architecture has undergone over the course of 16 centuries. This layered interactive experience is delivered through a set of embedded multimedia annotations, which contain textual, visual, and audio content, and functions as an epistemological device revealing the interpretive nature of visual and spatial representation of an historical artifact based on uncertain and at times conflicting data. The prototypical phase of the project completed during the fellowship will be disseminated through invited book chapters in Design, History and Time: New Temporalities in a Digital Age, ed. Zo&euml; Hendon and Anne Massey (Bloomsbury, February 2019) and in Imagined Forms: The Material Culture of Modeling, ed. Martin Brueckner, Sandy Isenstadt, and Sarah Wasserman (The University of Minnesota Press, forthcoming in 2020).</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">2016-2017 Award Year</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MuGaEvY-Z6TvKIcqfCGTZb41bewNgi_sNQKbNefhrNN_Xe8Yu3uiEBVaTgte5gUXksIeifRLozyoEkyR_CpMLxWPmP1WYLPTxRaan4JSGrTZXFUfJotEOU7XE1t4ALG7QTOlkBgI\" alt=\"Portrait of Adrienne Shaw\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" /></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrienne Shaw, Assistant Professor in the Department of Media Studies and Production, focuses on the history of LGBTQ representation in games. During her faculty fellowship, Dr. Adrienne Shaw worked on the LGBTQ Game Archive, an online database collecting information on all known LGBTQ content in digital games from the 1980s until today (<a href=\"http://www.lgbtqgamearchive.com/\">www.lgbtqgamearchive.com</a>). When the project started in 2015, the master list included 150 games and now totals over 1200. With assistance from the DSC Dr. Shaw worked specifically on a related project that entailed digitally archiving the primary materials used for the research on each game. By creating an Omeka database and corresponding hard drive or original research materials, she can ensure the information about these games and instances of content are saved for posterity at The Strong Museum of Play in Rochester New York. The structure for both were completed during the DSC fellowship year, and the following year a collaborator at Central Michigan University (Cody Mejeur) was able to develop a script to automatically process the rest of the materials. The Omeka site will launch and the hard drive will be available at The Strong in the Spring of 2019. This work also served as the basis for RAINBOW ARCADE, a first of it&rsquo;s kind exhibit on the history of LGBTQ video game content, that will open at the Schwules Museum in Berlin on December 13, 2019. Finally, she gave 8 invited talks and 7 conference presentations, as well as published one journal article and two book chapters related to the project during and immediately after the fellowship.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Zf10PyPlxNeQm5cR-yTcXcJgEc6KfFiiw-UNiLW65tSkfIk2FqxcbM4YqsxW0RTkRTrVyAuTR8HyIiJfEmOyHOO4G322kE1K80BvBi3D2mhP7SZffjX7acfS-HZw7wYBNsCNS5K5\" alt=\"Portrait of Colin Chamberlain\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" /></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Colin Chamberlain, assistant professor of philosophy, spent the academic year with the DSC building skills in the area of stylometric textual analysis so he could apply it to the work of Descartes.

She is interested in the technological manipulation of images and how different technologies are unique forms that invite different possibilities of showing the dancing body.&nbsp; She is also interested in exploring the possibilities of non-linear time that video allows. She integrates video into her live performances and also turns video of live performances into stand-alone pieces, seen here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=e7DL2GdhF_Y\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=e7DL2GdhF_Y&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Vivien Wise, MFA in Fibers and Material Studies</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/t1S6T-QRTUiibvyvvEI265GCzUBoXf-Pzni3IydlIfQ1vX49j0Jgb9VBlmY9E_o8lhpknhTrtLBvHLtWuOA9F8CumpVEMSxUZ1c5h0KNSiQaO8gvn1G6OQHrj-nIUV_ldS0wJj4p\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Vivien is an MFA student in Fibers and Material Studies at the Tyler School of Art. She is drawn and connected to the process and materiality of the rag rug, the quilt as art object, and the community formed by a knitting circle. Through explorations of materiality and tactility, her work comments on the concept of shared spaces and connections. Vivien searches for connections between others and herself to find community in this way. She is primarily a quilter.Vivien&rsquo;s project in the DSC is a combination of mapping, data, and traditional craft. She intends to create invented topographies that are based on a connection between land and body, relation to care, and connection to personal history.&nbsp; Her work can be viewed at, <a href=\"http://www.vivienwise.com/\">www.vivienwise.com</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bethany Farrell, PhD Art History</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FY89pFu-GPMcoHpzmJon6UuzdUIbQR1lIov-NOeyD3sM1hrhz4ZU-4s5_zlWR_NLrYeqYzumFst0cJYXBEoAvwhcMiyiuGSvi4jJa1EQo8efwidWuevG4Q-if6GNJ7SzP6x4DBTD\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" /></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bethany Farrell studies sixteenth-century Italian art, centering her dissertation on the painter Bronzino and the bureaucracy and transnational exchange of Duke Cosimo I&rsquo;s court.

It trains graduate students at Temple to apply digital research methods to humanistic or artistic material for their own research or creative projects. Participants meet weekly in the Fall for an introduction to digital research techniques. In Spring, students work on their own projects and meet every two weeks. At the end of the year, all participants present their projects to the scholarly community.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Digital Scholars 2018-2019:</h2>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Jessica L. Sitek, PhD, Religion</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a third year PhD student in the Department of Religion, participation in this year&rsquo;s Digital Scholars program will serve as part of my dissertation work. The proposed project uses postwar chaplaincy materials (manuals, pamphlets, histories, etc.) to examine how normative definitions of religion are formed, and specifically how official definitions are formed and function in a society that supposedly maintains separation of Church and State. This project is meant to serve as a foundation for broader work that considers the institutionalization of the chaplaincy as a clinical role, and its implications for care delivery.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Maik A Lally, PhD, Art History</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The topic of this digital scholarship project is to track the trade of devotional art, coins, and ideas that originated in Constantinople and spread through the Eastern Mediterranean on an interactive map. Comparing coins and art from different eras enables a view of the city&rsquo;s economy throughout its life while studying the spread of ideas allows for the conducting of research into a non-intrinsic trade system. One can compare the spread of artistic and theological ideas that occurred on these trade routes by analyzing artwork of churches in both Constantinople and the periphery regions.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Manna Duah, PhD, History</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My project uses data and network analysis to map eight incidents of mass political mobilizations among African students in US international education programs between 1960 and 1975.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Megan E. Reddicks Pignataro, PhD, Art History&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My digital project coincides with a chapter of my dissertation on how sculptors, like Donatello, in fifteenth century Florence created the impression of three-dimensions on a two-dimensional surface. I will examine a contemporary sculpture at the National Gallery of Art, DC, and create a digital 3D model to capture not only the spatial recession in the work, but also the sculpting textures themselves. This will help to visualize the artistic technique as well as demonstrate the early impact of sculpture in the history of optical perspective in Renaissance art.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Urszula Pruchniewska, PhD,&nbsp; Media and Communication</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This project examines the #metoo movement on Twitter, identifying and analyzing the tweets in the key moments of the movement using both an automated content analysis and critical discourse analysis.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Yang Shan Chou,&nbsp; MFA, Graphic &amp; Interactive Design</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My idea is to create an art project using physical computing, such as Arduino&rsquo;s, to explore the idea of the uncanny valley. The &ldquo;uncanny valley&rdquo; is defined as a phenomenon that occurs when a humanoid object resembles a human being, causing an unsettling effect for the viewers. Our experimental process will determine the form that the Uncanny Valley</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">phenomenon will take in our project. This project will be split into three parts: 1) starting the experiment, 2) forming it into a story, and 3) finally, creating an interactive display that will enable us to make modifications based on the audience&rsquo;s feedback.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Elizabeth J. White Vidarte</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This project is a test-run for a larger comparative project that will include patient memoirs, diaries, and letters. It uses computational textual analysis on primary sources in the history of psychiatric medicine to explore the&nbsp; rhetorics of care and dependency in different medical subcultures. Analyzing a corpus of nursing care manuals in contrast to a corpus of American Journal of Insanity volumes, all published between 1880 and 1950, this project asks: What kinds of differences are there in content and attitude between primarily male doctors and primarily female nurses? How do we account for those differences and how do they map across time?</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Digital Scholars 2017-2018:</h2>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Jeff P. Antsen, PhD, Political Science</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">U.S. history is punctuated by conflict over the social worth and legal equality of historically stigmatized and marginalized groups.&nbsp; The way media outlets discuss stigmatized groups can promote &ndash; or undermine &ndash; public affect and support for them. In my dissertation, Why Bother Choosing Anyway? : LGBT Community Framing, and the Role of Etiological Narrative Exposure, I study the different narratives that media outlets have drawn on over time, regarding the LGBT community.&nbsp; I study the ways LGBT issues are framed, and the aspects of the community that are focused on in mass communications.&nbsp; I use content analysis of media publications over the last 40 years to help understand how narratives have arisen, interacted, and diminished: over time, across the country, and in response to historical events.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Ania Korsunska, PhD, Media and Communications</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am second year PhD student in the Media and Communication department. My research focus is on how medical misinformation disseminates throughout various media outlets. Specifically focusing on studies of viral events, social media network analysis, information diffusion, and information &ldquo;network&rdquo; gatekeeping. Currently exploring R and Python programming languages, as well as network analysis/data visualization software such as Gephi.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Andrew Litts, PhD, Music Composition and Theory</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Data sonifiers seek aural applicability of their data, mapping research findings and other forms of data onto sonic parameters such as frequency, amplitude, rhythm, and timbre. A common thread among discussions in the field is the relevance of data sonification to music: at what point does the sonification become music, if it even should? I am sonifying the open-source data provided by SEPTA, Philadelphia&rsquo;s public transit authority, to turn real-time data about train location and timeliness into sound users can use on their ride to find out the status of their train or to learn about the system in whole.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Emily Logan, MS, Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Alodia Martin-Martinez, PhD, Spanish and Portuguese</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Connor L. D. Phillips, PhD, Media and Communications</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fake news has become a hot topic of conversation, especially on social media, but are we all describing the same thing? Judging from the many news sources who have been labelled &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; &ndash; from the New York Times and CNN to Breitbart &ndash; it would appear the term has no clear, singular meaning. The goal of this project is to understand what those meanings are and how people use them. I am using digital techniques to scrape social networking sites, like Twitter and Reddit, identify influencers, and analyze and visualize the different meanings and uses of &ldquo;fake news.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Keisha Wiel, Ph.D, Anthropology</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Keisha studies the relationship between language and identity in Aruba and Cura&ccedil;ao and its effects on language policy and education.&nbsp; More specifically, I research how people discuss and debate issues and ideologies surrounding Papiamentu, the official language in Aruba and Cura&ccedil;ao, on Facebook.&nbsp; How are people discussing the creole language compared to the colonial languages present on the islands? I want to further analyze whether these ideological debates mirror the sentiments of the speakers and if they affect language policies in education.&nbsp; I then use this data to research whether these ideologies are subsequently reinforced in a classroom setting.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Rachel Wildfeuer, PhD, Sociology</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rachel Wildfeuer&rsquo;s planned dissertation will analyze the influence of place in the United States using the concept of the American Dream. Rachel, a PhD student in the department of sociology, plans to explore the extent to which place matters for the American Dream (confidence in it and achievement of it) because of the people that live there, because of the context of the place, and because of changes over time. Her digital project will include textual analysis of the concept of the American Dream and mapping geocoded data to visualize the influence of place.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Digital Scholars 2016-2017:</h2>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Juan Larrosa-Fuentes, PhD, SMC clinton and latino media</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Robert W.

In her dissertation, &ldquo;Architectural Decorum and Aristocratic Power in Late Antiquity: The Gens Anicii,&rdquo; Kaelin explores the architectural and artistic mechanics of power and display as employed by the aristocratic families of cities such as Rome, Ravenna, and Constantinople during the 4th through the late-6th centuries CE. It is through new and exciting digital tools and the support of Temple&rsquo;s Digital Scholarship Center, that Kaelin will be able to conceptualize and visualize the lost monuments, urban topographies, and complex family histories of late antiquity. Currently, Kaelin is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Art History at the Tyler School of Art and holds an M.A. in Art History, a B.F.A. in Photography and a B.A. in Archaeology (all from the University of Louisville). She has participated in on-site seminars in Istanbul and Cappadocia in addition to conducting research for her dissertation in Italy and Croatia, generously funded by the International Center for Medieval Art.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Melissa Meade &ndash; Media and Communication</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Labaron Palmer &ndash; Geography and Urban Studies</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Jaclyn Partyka &ndash; MFA, English</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Joyce Rasing &ndash; Geography</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Joyce Rasing is a graduate student in the Department of Geography and Urban Studies, pursing a Professional Science Master&rsquo;s in Geographic Information Systems. She also received her Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the College of Liberal Arts here at Temple in December 2014. Past projects include using ArcGIS for various mapping projects for the City of Philadelphia and non-profit organizations ranging from poverty and insurance coverage to education and targeted outreach while making use of census data and organization-based data. Other projects included organizational social media analyses via Google and Twitter APIs. She is interested in linking violent non-state actors (VNSAs, such as terrorist groups, insurgencies, or criminal organizations) to geography using social network analysis based on mode of attack and target type by location and how certain groups have changed over the course of time.<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e9304061-7fff-b8c9-30db-c99b9034e205\"></span></p>",

The potential of this building&mdash;to support and engender innovation, making, and scholarship at Temple&mdash;is as exciting as the architecture that guides it. Charles Library also serves as a center for community engagement, public programs, and a variety of activities that welcome in our neighbors, colleagues, and friends.<br /><br />Through this building, we have an opportunity to transform conversations on libraries as they move from passive storehouses to active sites for discovery, knowledge creation, and creative engagement with ideas and culture. This library sets a new standard for how the 21st century research library looks, feels, operates, and serves its constituencies.<br /><br />Please look through our image galleries, and see for yourself how design meets function at Temple&rsquo;s Charles Library. If you&rsquo;d like to join me in a commitment to the boundless future of the Libraries by making a transformative gift, please call 215-204-9305 or email&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:dwash@temple.edu\">dwash@temple.edu</a>.

        "description": "<div id=\"newlib-about\">\r\n<p>Even as news and information are delivered to devices we hold in our hands, some things will never come from a screen. Engagement with a community of which we are an essential part. That special energy that comes from face-to-face interaction with people and ideas. And the singular importance of the tactile, an object held in many hands, which connects students and scholars with the past, collapsing time. Place matters, and Temple University&rsquo;s design for the new Charles Library shows that the spaces we inhabit can influence and elevate the work we do in them.<br /><br />Designed by world-renowned architectural firm Sn&oslash;hetta, Charles Library will be a catalyst for learning, a structure that comes along but once in a lifetime. Developed to inspire the creation of knowledge, to engage and connect, the library will introduce users to evolving technologies and the purposes they serve. It makes a bold statement to potential students and faculty about Temple&rsquo;s commitment to education and scholarship. And it will realize our broader vision of creating community and making learning exciting and accessible.</p>\r\n<h2>About the Libraries</h2>\r\n<p>Temple University Libraries serve as trusted keepers of the intellectual and cultural record&mdash;collecting, describing, providing access to, and preserving a broad universe of materials, including physical and digital collections, rare and unique books, manuscripts, archives, ephemera, and the products of scholarly enterprise at Temple.

        "description": "<div id=\"newlib-about\">\r\n<p>This project provides a unique opportunity to exponentially grow the Library Endowment and provide dedicated, permanent funding for both this world-class building and the services, collections, staff, and programs it houses. Gifts made to name specific spaces will be applied, unless otherwise specified or requested, to the Library Endowment, which supports regularly scheduled operational needs and opportunities as they arise. A gift toward an endowment is truly an investment in the present and future of Charles Library, as it provides ongoing support that benefits current and future generations of students, scholars, faculty, staff, and community members. What is more, your named gift will be linked to this extraordinary building in perpetuity.</p>\r\n<h2>Endowment Spending and Investment</h2>\r\n<p>The monies in this endowment are invested for long-term stability and growth and are spent at a rate of 4.5% per year. This allows the Libraries to steadily maintain and enhance facilities, continue purchasing and preserving materials and collections, attract and retain high-quality faculty and staff, and support evolving technology and innovation. By naming a space or fund, your gift provides long-term value as a steady and growing source of income for the Libraries.</p>\r\n<h2>Planned Giving</h2>\r\n<p>You can secure your legacy and commitment to this project with cash gifts&mdash;made in a single contribution or over a period of up to five years&mdash;or through an array of planned giving vehicles. Wills, trusts, estate plans, annuities, retirement funds, and beneficiary designations are just a few of the ways to make a long-term, planned gift. Additionally, many planned giving options are income-bearing, benefiting you, your family, and the future of Temple University Libraries.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/sites/default/files/naming_schedule_5.21.19.pdf\">Click here to view a full list of naming opportunities.</a></p>\r\n<h2>Additional Giving Opportunities</h2>\r\n<h3>Endowment Giving</h3>\r\n<h4>Technology Endowment, $1,000,000</h4>\r\n<p>Though flexibility and futurecasting guide the building&rsquo;s technology planning, the extensive equipment, interfaces, and tools throughout require continued assessment, monitoring, and maintenance. The Technology Endowment supports upgrades and routine work on both transformative, large-scale, operational technologies, like the BookBot and Digital Display Wall, and the multitude of smaller-scale, user-facing materials such as work stations, graduate and faculty studios, and makerspaces.</p>\r\n<h4>Digital Preservation Endowment, $500,000</h4>\r\n<p>Digital preservation greatly increases the discovery and use-value of the Libraries&rsquo; unique special collections by making them available via the web. It also extends the life of physical and material resources by reducing the frequency with which they are handled. The Digital Preservation Endowment ensures the promise of Charles Library&rsquo;s onsite, state-of-the-art conservation and digitization labs, and enables the Libraries to continue to scan materials and catalog and mount digital objects to both the Libraries&rsquo; website and the Digital Public Library of America.</p>\r\n<h4>Exhibition Endowment, $500,000</h4>\r\n<p>This fund ensures the promise of both the special programs gallery and the dedicated Special Collections Research Center display area through the purchase of high-quality exhibition cases, mounts, and other specialized furnishings and equipment. This gift will help to build an in-house stock of materials to stage and prepare exhibitions of varying forms, formats, and mediums, and to schedule traveling exhibitions and expand the Libraries&rsquo; interpretive program as the opportunity arises.</p>\r\n<h4>Library Innovation Endowment, $500,000</h4>\r\n<p>This building is forward-looking and designed to foster innovation over the long term through highly flexible spaces and a technologically rich environment. It is not possible, however, to foresee every potential transformation in scholarly and creative output. This fund ensures that the Libraries can take advantage of exciting projects and new opportunities as they arise.</p>\r\n<h4>Public Program Endowment, $500,000</h4>\r\n<p>Charles Library&rsquo;s event and gallery spaces are the first dedicated programming areas at the university&rsquo;s central library. The Public Program Endowment will supplement operational budget allocations, hence ensuring lively, timely, and high-quality events, exhibitions, lectures, workshops, screenings, and performances at the library.</p>\r\n<h3>One Time Gifts</h3>\r\n<h4>Class Gifts, $100,000</h4>\r\n<p>Reunion and class gifts of $100,000 and over may be applied to any naming or funding opportunity available for Charles Library. Classes may make either endowed or one-time gifts. Visit alumni.temple.edu or giving.temple.edu for more information on how to organize a class gift.</p>\r\n<h4>Exhibition Cases, $50,000 each</h4>\r\n<p>Furnishings, supplies, and specialized equipment are purchased during preparation and building phases of the library project. A variety of high quality, permanent exhibition cases are needed to outfit both the Special Collections Research Center and the First Floor Exhibition Space. A one-time, non-endowed, cash gift of $50,000 will purchase and name an exhibition case. Donors may purchase and name more than one case.</p>\r\n</div>",
