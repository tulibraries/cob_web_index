Cob Index is a repository to hold the traject configuration files and scripts associated with indexing of the library website entities.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cob_web_index'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cob_web_index

## Usage

`cob_web_index` is an executable.  You can use it to ingest files into SOLR_WEB_URL with

```
cob_web_index ingest $path_to_file
```

`$path_to_file` can also be a URL.

Note also that `$path_to_file` is an optional argument. If not provided then by default ingest will attempt to download the latest website dataset and import that.


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
